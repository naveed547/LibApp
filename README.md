# How to run LibApp

This example demos a basic host application loading from different remote component.

- LibApp is not a runnable instance. Just start server for other remotes to access the shared data.

## Running Demo
1. Under LibApp Remote
    * npm install
    * npm start

- localhost:8085 (STANDALONE REMOTE LibApp holds all lib, store and context)
